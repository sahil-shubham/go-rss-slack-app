# Slack RSS app written in Go

This is an open source slack intergration to generate rss feeds and notify about updates directly on your Slack workspace.

## How to use?

This is currently in planning stage ðŸš§

## Why? 

This project has stemmed from my likeness of rss, interests of learning Go and not finding a good FOSS Slack RSS integration. 

- **This would be free to use.** Currently available alternatives have limit which run out quickly.
- Rss is amazing. You wouldn't miss any articles, tweets or posts. It would give quick updates to changes in the sites/social platforms you subscribe to.
- Setting this up in a workspace can help in intiating discussions and conversations regarding topics, articles or news updates. 
- Currently planning to support the following platforms for feed generation and parsing: 
  - Twitter
  - Reddit
  - YouTube
  - Blogs
